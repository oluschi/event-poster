		<h1> What is AfroFuturism? </h1>
      	<p>Afro-futurism is a cultural aesthetic, philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African diaspora and culture with an infusion of technology. This conference highlights this re-emerging trend of Afrofuturism to the public through a discussion lead conversation between designers and stylists within the realm of fashion.
